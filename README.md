### Hi there, thanks for visiting my profile!

Hi, my name is André Ataíde, but you can call me Vykos. 

I am a Cyber Security student and an enthusiast about open-source Self-Sovereign Identity solutions. Currently, I am committed to advancing my knowledge in IAM and its various aspects, including provisioning, authentication, and authorization. As part of my career development, I am seeking a position or internship that allows me to actively contribute to IAM initiatives, collaborate with IAM teams, and gain hands-on experience in implementing and managing IAM solutions. 

In addition, I also hope to be an open-source maintainer soonly. I have learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through this community.

I am a curious and steadfast student, please be kind. 🙂

Consider getting in touch.
