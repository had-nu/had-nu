### Hi there, thanks for visiting my profile!

Hi, my name is André. Welcome!

Experienced professional in Project Management and Digital Transformation with a growing focus on Application Security. Currently working as an Application Security Researcher, my research contributes to improving the security posture of companies within the Salvador Caetano Group. I collaborate with the InfoSec team and development leadership to establish the organization's first Application Security team. My work involves supporting the development of secure application architectures, creating standards based on ISO/IEC 27001, NIST, and OWASP, and producing comprehensive documentation. The goal is to integrate security best practices throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), shifting security left to address vulnerabilities early in the development process, where they can be resolved more efficiently and cost-effectively.

Here are the trainings and certifications I am currently pursuing:
- Official ISC2 Online Training for Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)
- Cisco English for IT B2 / GSE 59-75 Certification
- Cisco Cyber Threat Management Certificate

For my next set of trainings and certifications, I plan to undertake:
- ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) - Mar/24
- CompTIA Sec+
- GIAC Cyber Threat Intelligence (GCTI)

I hope this section provides a clearer view of my academic and professional activities and highlights my commitment to continuous learning and practical experience in cybersecurity. Feel free to send me a message.

I am a curious and steadfast student, please be kind. 🙂
