### Hi there, thanks for visiting my profile!

Hi, my name is Andr√©. Welcome!

Experienced professional in project management and digital transformation. Currently, I work as an Application Security Researcher and am developing my dissertation project, which aims to implement a strategy that integrates security practices throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC).

My role is to support the continuous improvement of the security posture of companies within the Salvador Caetano Group by developing and implementing an application security program. I represent the AppSec team in the organization‚Äôs strategy, helping to develop secure architecture, standards, and documentation. The goal is to incorporate security into the SDLC as early as possible, shifting it left in the activity flow. This approach reduces the number of vulnerabilities introduced during development when it is still cheaper and simpler to address them.

In addition to my focus on cybersecurity, I have a strong interest in anti-corruption initiatives, transparency, digital identity, and freedom of information. Outside of work, I enjoy photography and exploring topics related to Cyber Intelligence and Social Engineering.

Here are the trainings and certifications I am currently pursuing:
- Official ISC2 Online Training for Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)
- Cisco English for IT B2 / GSE 59-75 Certification
- Cisco Cyber Threat Management Certificate

For my next set of trainings and certifications, I plan to undertake:
- ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) - Mar/24
- CompTIA Sec+
- GIAC Cyber Threat Intelligence (GCTI)

I hope this section provides a clearer view of my academic and professional activities and highlights my commitment to continuous learning and practical experience in cybersecurity. Feel free to send me a message.

I am a curious and steadfast student, please be kind. üôÇ
